This React Native code throws an error because the state update is happening asynchronously, resulting in the `this.state.count` value being stale when used in the `setCount` method.  The solution is to use the functional update pattern to ensure you are using the latest state value.  Incorrect:
```javascript
setCount(this.state.count + 1);
```
Correct:
```javascript
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
```
